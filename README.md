## **VaccMan System (Vaccination Management System)**

### Description:
The main purpose of our program is to store a compilation of
vaccinated BatStateU students within Alangilan campus. The compilation
of the students’ information are grouped by their program and course.
Student’s information includes the following : Name, Gender, Address ,
SR- code , Program & Course , Section, Vaccine brand , and their
Vaccination Status ( First dose/ Fully Vaccinated). The compilation will be
encoded as an excel file for a more organized list. This program would be
beneficial to the university in order to identify the vaccination status of
students in preparation for the face-to-face class.
