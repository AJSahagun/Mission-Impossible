## **D-CS-IT (Digital Dictionary for CS & IT)**

### Description:
As computer science students, we know the difficulty in retaining all the
syntaxes of different programming languages. The purpose of this program is to
provide the purpose of different syntaxes of various programming language
specifically C++, Java, and Python.
D-CS-IT has two functionalities:
1. It will show the list of all the syntaxes of the programming language in
alphabetical order together with its purpose.
2. Enable the user to find the purpose of a specified syntax of a programming
language the user wanted to look for.
From the programming languages given above (C++, Java, Python), the user can
choose one among them. After choosing one, the list of all the syntaxes from that
specific programming language will be shown.
